I have done the multy UV, view direction and world position shaders, but the reflection shader.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Strenth: I haven't find any of my strenth on this frankly.
Weakness:To be honest, these three projects really caught me off guard. Although I learnt shader graph before but hlsl is more complicated. Therefore, I just felt overwhelmed while doing this assignment and I really spent a lot of time on these three yet understand only 20%. 
Opportunity: In the coming week, I will review the slides and look for more tutorials and information to get more knowledge about shader/hlsl. Hopefully I can acquire basics of the shader.
